# Rijan's Digital Art Gallery

This is my ICT171 Assignment 2 cloud server project for Murdoch University. The project demonstrates the setup and deployment of a secure website on an AWS EC2 instance using Apache2. It showcases a digital art gallery using HTML, CSS, and cloud infrastructure, with automated Apache monitoring and version control via GitHub.
